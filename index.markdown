About this site: Made with Jekyll and the default minima theme. Inspired by [Colorie](https://colorie.netlify.app/about). Title font is UnifrakturCook (although the Futura version was also fun) and everything else is Inter. Media breakpoint is set at 800px. Test deployment is Vercel, production deployment is Github Pages. PagesCMS will be used to make changes to page content.
